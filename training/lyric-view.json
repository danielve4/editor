Here's to the middle of the road!\nAt least it's better than here\"\n\n[Chorus 1]\nLooking for a cause\nBut all I got was Santa Claus\nI'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die\nI feel like a cello\nLost somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high, too scared to dream\nBut too dumb to die\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy daddy always was on strike\nGoing off with the Teamsters\nHe said that \"Everything will be alright...\nNot every Sunday can be Easter\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThe picket line screamed:\n\"Woah! Don't cross\nDon't cross the line because you'll be a scab, not a martyr!\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nLooking for a cause\nBut all I got was camouflage\nI'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die\nI feel like a cello\nLost somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high\nToo scared to dream\nBut too dumb to... uhm... yeah..\nHey!\n\n[Chorus 2]\nLooking for a cause\nBut all I got was camouflage\nI'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die\nI feel like a cello\nLost somewhere over the rainbow\nWay up high, too scared to dream\nBut too dumb to die\n\n"
